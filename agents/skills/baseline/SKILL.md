# Baseline

## Overview

**Baseline** is a Ruby gem providing reusable modules, patterns, and infrastructure for Ruby applications: authentication, task management, invoicing, messaging, admin panels, and third-party service integrations. Baseline can be used in Rails apps via its Rails engine but also in non-Rails Ruby apps, e.g. Sinatra.

## Source

Find the source of Baseline in `~/code/own/baseline`. Warn the user if that folder cannot be found.
